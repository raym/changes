I iii vi IV
I iii vi IV

[ Verse 1 ]

I                   iii
I heard that you're settled down

         vi                      IV
That you found a girl and you're married now

I                 iii
I heard that your dreams came true


          vi                       IV
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you

I                       iii
Old friend, why are you so shy?

           vi                  IV
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light


[ Pre-Chorus ]

  V                          vi
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited

      IV
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

    V                           vi
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded

         IV
That for me it isn't over

[Chorus]

I                V                 vi  IV
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

       I               V        vi  IV
I wish nothing but the best for you two

         I         V           vi         IV
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said

             I                 V                    vi    IV
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

             I                 V                    vi    IV
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]

    I            iii
You know how the time flies

     vi                IV
Only yesterday was the time of our lives

        I                    iii
We were born and raised in a summer haze

      vi                     IV
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]

  V                          vi
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited

      IV
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

    V                       vi
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded

         IV
That for me it isn't over

[Chorus]

I                V                 vi  IV
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

       I               V        vi  IV
I wish nothing but the best for you two

         I         V           vi         IV
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said

             I                 V                    vi     IV
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

[Bridge]

V
Nothing compares, no worries or cares

  vi
Regrets and mistakes, they are memories made

IV                             ii    I          IV 
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Chorus]

I                V                 vi  IV
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

       I               V        vi  IV
I wish nothing but the best for you...

         I         V           vi         IV
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said

             I                 V                    vi    IV
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

[Chorus]

I                V                 vi  IV
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

       I               V        vi  IV
I wish nothing but the best for you two

         I         V           vi         IV
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said

             I                 V                    vi    IV
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

             I                 V                    vi    IV
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

[Outro]

I
