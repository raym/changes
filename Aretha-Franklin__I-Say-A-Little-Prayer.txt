[Intro]

vi IV V I IV iii7

[Verse]

vi                 VI
The moment I wake up

             V        I
Before I put on my makeup

   IV                     iii7
I say a little prayer for you

vi               IV
While combing my hair, now,

                     V       I
And wondering what dress to wear, now,

   IV                 iii7
I say a little prayer for you


[Chorus]

IV          V            V          vi 
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart

            V
and I will love you

IV          V            V        vi 
Forever, forever, we never will part

            V
Oh, how I'll love you

IV          V             V        vi 
Together, together, that's how it must be

            V
To live without you

IV           V            iii7
Would only be heartbreak for me.

[Verse]

vi              IV
I run for the bus, dear,

                V       I
While riding I think of us, dear,

IV                        iii7
I say a little prayer for you.

vi             IV
At work I just take time

                   V       I
And all through my coffee break-time,

   IV                     iii7
I say a little prayer for you.

[Chorus]

IV          V            V          vi 
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart

            V
and I will love you

IV          V            V        vi 
Forever, forever, we never will part

            V
Oh, how I'll love you

IV          V             V        vi 
Together, together, that's how it must be

            V
To live without you

IV           V            iii7
Would only be heartbreak for me.

[End Bridge]

vi             IV
My darling believe me,

          V           
For me there is no one

I
But you.

I
Answer my Prayer

I
This is my prayer
